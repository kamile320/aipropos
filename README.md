# aipropos
Linux simple 'apropos'-like command that uses AI

Search for command after describing it.  
Uses Google's Gemini API - you need to create API Token in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and type it in .env file.  
I recommend installing it via .deb file (it will work as normal linux command) - source code works only in one directory.  

Usage: aipropos [command description]
